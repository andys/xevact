# Case is important!


# Valid Event Types
#
# KeyPress		KeyRelease		ButtonPress [2]	MotionNotify
# EnterNotify		LeaveNotify		FocusIn		KeymapNotify
# CreateNotify		DestroyNotify		UnmapNotify	MapRequest [1]
# Expose		GraphicsExpose		NoExpose	
# GravityNotify		ResizeRequest	 [1]	CirculateNotify	
# SelectionNotify	ColormapNotify		ClientMessage	
# PropertyNotify	SelectionClear		SelectionRequest [1]
# ConfigureNotify	ConfigureRequest [1]	ReparentNotify	
# ButtonRelease		FocusOut		MapNotify
# VisibilityNotify	CirculateRequest [1]	MappingNotify
# [1] -- These events are for window-managers and the like; since this
#	 program doesn't /send/ events (yet), these are disabled.
# [2] -- Only one client can select ButtonPress events per window;
#	 Selecting this will likely cause the program to fail --use
#	 ButtonRelease instead.


# Valid Test-Functions
#
#	Name		Condition [1]
#	Test_State	state code (Shift, Control, Meta, Compose)
#	Test_KeyCode	keysym or keycode ('a', "Shift", 129)
#	Test_True
#	Test_False
#	-
#[1] -- The condition may be:
#         o  a number, interpreted as a literal (used for specifying
#	     literal keycodes found from the PrintEvent call.)
#	  o  a string enclosed in quotes ('' or ""), intepreted as
#	     a text keysym and converted into a keycode.
#	  o  a string not enclosed in quotes.  The value is gotten
#	     from an internal program table; used for things like
#	     shift, control, etc for states.
#	(literal keycodes are server dependant: Avoid them!)


# Valid Calls (Actions)
#
#	Name		Parameters		Meaning
#	PlaySound	filename		plays the filename
#	System		/bin/sh cmd line	string is passed to system()		
#	PrintStr	string			printf("%s\n",string);
#	PrintKey				print key as ascii
#	PrintEvent				print loads of event info
#	NoAction				does nothing
#	-					does nothing

# Valid Flags
#
#	Flag		Meaning
#	S		if the call-function was called, do not go on.
#	T		terminate after this action, processed or not!
#	F		fork() and call this action in a subprocess.
#	D		always set action's prev time to the current time.
#	-		No Flags
# S|T --These are useful for excluding other specific actions.  They are
#	also useful when dealing with delay-times.
# F  -- This is mainly put in for the AudioFile sound function;  playing
#	samples doesn't return until all the data has been sent to the
#	server, so for large files this is basically the time spent to play
#	the file.  By forking a new process, we can conintue to handle
#	new events while the large sample is playing. (this works for any
#	action-call, however it adds a bit of overhead).  Plus, the file
#	only gets loaded in the forked process so it doesn't hang around in
#	memory.
# D  -- keep delaying the action; set the action's last time to current
#	even if the action was not performed because it happened too close
#	to the last time.

# Notes
#
#   1	The DEFAULT action only happens if no other actions were done for 
#	particular event.  So if you have an event with no test-functions
#	then the default will /never/ happen.
#   2	Specifying the DEFAULT action counts as a test-function.
#   3   Keycodes: 'a' is equal to 'A' --you need to use Test_State to
#	select between them.
#   4	The delay is measured in seconds,millisecs (.1 sec == 100000 usec)
#   5	To test for multiple states, you must use a Test_State for each one.
#   6	Putting a "!" before the test-function switches True/False for that test.
