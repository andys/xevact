Okay, read the INSTALL to get it set up.

What the program is supposed to to is to let you take x-windows
events and do things (actions) with them.  My original concept
was just to make the computer sound like an old IBM Selectric (I
think I spelled that right), but I couldn't find the sounds for
it :(

Anyhow, you can do that, but you can also do something with just
about any x-windows event... from ColormapNotify to Expose, and
of course the KeyPress too! ;) And you can do a bunch of things
for the same event, or just one thing (or nothing).

The program reads expressions from a file.  Each expression
(currently expressions are the same as lines of text) consists of
tests and an action.  When an event comes in, it is checked
agains all expressions;  the tests for that expression are given
the event.  If all the tests are true, the action function is
called.

It should be really easy to build new tests and action functions to suit
your needs, and it is one way of getting around the awkward
syntax xevact uses.  See the NOTES for details.

So like, send comments and stuff (and if you write new tests,
actions send me the source code for it!) to jmaxwell@acm.vt.edu
