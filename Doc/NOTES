Some event masks are not set properly in table.c, an easy way to disable
them from use.  Most are *Request types, which are used if you can send
events too; since xevact can not send events yet, those few event types are
disabled.

Adding new tests or Actions:
  Under Src/tests and Src/actions are a bunch of tiny C files, each of
  which contain one test or action function.  The filenames are the name of
  the function plus ".c".  This makes it easy to add new functions and to
  update the input tables.  All you do to add new ones is to write the
  function, naming the file with the function name, and use make_actions or
  make_tests (depending on the directory) to rebuild the include files.

  This way you can just drop new functions into the directory and recompile,
  everything should work correctly --you can trade new functions or tests with
  your friends.

  You will want to check out the file Src/h/xevact_struct.h for the action
  structure; it gets passed to test and action functions so they can have
  access to any of a wide range of data, but all have the same parameters.
  
Tests and actions calls are looked up in the same table, and no difference
is made between them.  So, a call can be used where the program expects an
action, resulting in a core-dump (or undefined behavior).

AF sound drops out;  it doesn't play the first bit of the sound.  It calls
AFGetTime() and then AFPlaySamples() with that time.  If anyone knows what
the problem is, please let me know!
