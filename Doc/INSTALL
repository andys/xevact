Hopefully everything will compile, but I've only tried it on Digital Unix &
the DECstation, and have little experience writing portable code.  Sorry, no
Imakefile! :(

cd Src
Edit the Makefile for Xlibs and sound (if you have Audiofile).
make all
cd ..

You may want to edit Src/h/xevact_const.h, say to change the default
data file.

"xevact -help" for usage.

This is all documented in the sample actions files:
	Dat/print.event		detailed info
	Dat/print.keys		just the keys pressed
	Dat/play.sounds		sounds for some events

The pathnames in the sounds example are in the form Dat/sounds/file.au, so
run it from the top directory or it won't be able to find the files.

From the top directory, you can try it with these commands:
	./xevact -actions Dat/print.event
	./xevact -actions Dat/print.keys
	./xevact -actions Dat/play.sounds
